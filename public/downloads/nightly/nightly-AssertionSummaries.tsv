HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to various targeted therapies including the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab. The use of Trastuzumab, often in combination with chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy (depending on hormone receptor status), is now standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.	2	529,528,1122	306	20	2018-01-17 16:41:35 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/2	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/529,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/528,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1122	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/306	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/20

ALK-FUSIONS are found in 3-5% of non-small cell lung cancer and act as a targetable driver mutation. the ALK inhibitor crizotinib was effective in lung cancer patients with ALK fusions and was granted accelerated FDA approval in 2011. The Vysis break-apart FISH assay is an FDA approved test for the presence of ALK fusion. NCCN guideline version 9.2017 lists crizotinib as approved first-line NSCLC treatment in the presence of ALK fusions but now lists alectinib as preferred first-line therapy.	3	1189,1245,1207,262,1691,1577,1419,1201,1200,4858,1199,1198,1187,1197,1356,1193,1190,1196	499	1	2018-01-17 16:39:16 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/3	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1189,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1245,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1207,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/262,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1691,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1577,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1419,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1201,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1200,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/4858,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1199,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1198,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1187,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1197,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1356,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1193,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1190,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1196	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/499	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1
